Block Builder Fellow, Engineering
A six-month, paid program for AI-native builders. Fellows join teams at Cash App, Square, Afterpay, TIDAL, Bitkey, and Proto to push how AI reshapes the way we design, build, and imagine new experiences.

This isn't an internship â€” it's a launchpad for builders. No degree or resume required. Just curiosity, initiative, and examples of what you've built.

The Role
As a Fellow, you'll use AI-assisted development to build, prototype, and ship. You'll demonstrate what's possible when AI is woven directly into engineering.

You'll partner with engineers, product managers, and designers to turn wild ideas into working demos in hours, not weeks. You'll help define new development patterns, create reusable AI-powered frameworks, and share your learnings across Block Engineering.

This role is ideal for builders with an entrepreneurial spirit and work that speaks louder than a resume.

You Will
Ship production-ready code with AI-assisted tools (goose, Cursor, Claude Code, Copilot, etc.)
Explore, test, and integrate emerging AI/ML tools, LLM APIs, MCP servers, and frameworks into Block's products
Build internal automations, scripts, and utilities that make teams faster and more productive
Rapidly prototype new ideas with product managers and designers, building proofs-of-concept that unlock new possibilities
Contribute to AI-first product experiences and UX patterns
Document learnings and build AI playbooks that can scale across Block Engineering
Actively participate in two-way learning by leading demos, sharing experiments, and mentoring peers on AI-first building, while also gaining hands-on experience building enterprise software
You Have
Strong engineering fluency in AI/ML: plus one or more of web/frontend, mobile, UI, full-stack, or creative tech, shown through projects, not just credentials
An AI builder mindset: you use AI as a creative amplifier, learn by doing, experiment, and ship ideas that push the boundaries of innovation
A growth perspective: seeking feedback, leveling up quickly, and contributing to real products while sharing knowledge with others
Multidisciplinary curiosity: you thrive in cross-disciplinary collaboration
Bonus if You've
Shipped personal AI projects with real users (even small ones)
Won hackathons, contributed to open source, or built viral AI experiments
Written, taught, or shared about AI development (videos, blogs, tutorials, threads)
Participated actively in AI communities (Discord, Reddit, X/Twitter, etc.)
What You'll Get
Embedded in a Block product facing engineering team, working on real products (Cash App, Tidal, Square, etc.)
Mentorship from senior engineers and product leaders
Exposure to cutting-edge tools and practices (goose, Cursor, Claude Code, etc.)
A community of like-minded builders
Opportunity to launch a career in Engineering at Block
Show us what you've built! Send in samples of your work that highlight how you've used AI in your projects: code, prototypes, automations, or apps. We care more about what you've created than what's on your resume.
